### Task-04: Educational Keylogger

### Description
⚠️ FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY ⚠️

This tool demonstrates how keyloggers function as a cybersecurity awareness application. It includes explicit consent mechanisms and visual indicators when active to ensure ethical usage.

### Features
- Explicit consent requirement before activation
- Persistent visual indicator when the keylogger is active
- Real-time keystroke logging with precise timestamps
- Status updates showing current activity
- Multiple ways to stop logging (ESC key or stop button)
- Detailed session summary upon completion

### Installation
```bash
pip install keyboard
```

### Usage
- Run the application: `python ethical_keylogger2.py`
- Read the ethical warning and consent information carefully
- Click "Start Logging" ONLY if using on your own system for educational purposes
- A visible status window will remain on screen while logging is active
- Press ESC key or click "Stop Logging" button to end the session
- Review the log file (keylog.txt) to understand keystroke capture

### Ethical Considerations (IMPORTANT)
- This tool is ONLY for educational purposes
- NEVER use on another person's computer without explicit consent
- NEVER use for malicious purposes
ALWAYS ensure users are aware of logging
Using keyloggers on others without consent is illegal in most jurisdictions
All logged data stays local and is stored in keylog.txt
